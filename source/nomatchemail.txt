Unfortunately we weren't able to match you up this month for a coffee with another member of the Obtainium COP. This doesn't happen often, but does occur occasionally if there is an odd number of people or if many people have limited availability to meet. <br><br>We'll try again next month to get you matched. In the meanwhile, sometimes it's nice to go out solo: find a spot outside, sip a cup of something soothing and read a book or listen to your favorite tunes. <br><br>Should you have any questions about Coffee With Strangers or Obtainium, please send a note to Obtainium@kp.org. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Obtainium COP
